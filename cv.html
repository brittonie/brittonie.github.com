			"It had a perfectly round door like a porthole, painted green, with a shiny yellow brass knob in the exact middle.
			 The door opened on to a tube-shaped hall like a tunnel: a very comfortable tunnel without smoke, with paneled walls 
			 and floors tiled and carpeted, provided with polished chairs, and lots and lots of pegs for hats and coats--the hobbit
			  was fond of visitors. The tunnel wound on and on, going fairly but not quite straight into the side of the hill--The Hill, 
			  as all the people for many miles round called it--and many little round doors opened out of it, first on one side and then 
			  on another. No going upstairs for the hobbit: bedrooms, bathrooms, cellars, pantries (lots of these), wardrobes (he had whole 
			  rooms devoted to clothes), kitchens, dining-rooms, all were on the same floor, and indeed on the same passage. The best rooms 
			  were all on the lefthand side (going in), for these were the only ones to have windows, deep-set round windows looking over
			  his garden and meadows beyond, sloping down to the river."
